          After gaining work experience in RPA and Project Management, 
          I obtained the "Multimedia Products Designer" certification in 2023, 
          further expanding my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          In 2025, I completed a WordPress development course and attended the
          MuleSoft Academy, acquiring expertise in API-led connectivity using the Anypoint Platform,
          including API Manager and Anypoint Studio.
          I also gained practical knowledge in DataWeave (JSON, XML, CSV transformations),
          integration testing with mUnit, and deployment on CloudHub and on-premise environments.
